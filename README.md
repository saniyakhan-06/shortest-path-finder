# Shortest Path Finder (Python)

Created: July 20, 2025

This Python project finds the shortest path between two points in a grid or graph using classic pathfinding algorithms.  
It can be used for maze solving, navigation, or routing applications.

# Features
- Supports grid or graph input
- Implements algorithms like:
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Outputs the shortest path steps or visualizes the path

# How to Run

```bash
python shortest_path_finder.py
